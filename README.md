# BigBasket-Data-Analysis
Applied Apriori (type of Associative Rule Learning) to find out top 10(arranged in order of Lift parameter) most frequently bought pair of items on BigBasket.
# BigBasket Recommendation System

This project implements a recommendation system for BigBasket using the Apriori algorithm. It identifies frequently bought itemsets and generates association rules to suggest products to customers based on their purchase patterns.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loaded and processed transactional data for analysis.
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Used to generate association rules based on specified support, confidence, and lift thresholds.
- **Results Visualization**: Identified top product pairs with high lift values for effective recommendations.

## Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- apyori (for Apriori algorithm implementation)

## How to Use
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install apyori pandas matplotlib
2.Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BigBasket-Recommendation-System.git
